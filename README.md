<br> 
<p>Our main objective via this project is to bring uniformity in the Indian Universities by introducing a calender for management of the Indian Universirties registered under AICTE.</p>
<p>Our entire project is divided into 3 parts-</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Student Section</strong>-The student section is the section which will be dirctly accessible to the users.It has some highlighting features like searching,checking the college calender and application to the college all from a simple and easy to use model.</li>
<li><strong>College Section</strong>-The College section will require login to access the functionality.The college will be able to access the calender with full control to plan out the important events following the AICTE deadlines.The college statistics will also be available for all colleges to encourage healthy competition</li>
<li><strong>Admin(AICTE) Section</strong>-The Admin section will require login and the credentials will be predefined.The Admin will be able to create a generalized calender which is to be followed by the colleges.This will ensure uniformity and discipline.The Admin will also be able to see the statistical data of various colleges to cross check the following of schedules and and cross check of student activity on the college page.</li>

</ol>

<h3 align="center">Unique Features</h3>
<hr>
<ol>
<li><strong>Simplicity</strong>-We have kept the product as simple as possible by maintaing a simple and easy to use UI/UX design to simple and efficient backend algorithms.This not only decreses the server load and runtime but also makes the application usable for all the age groups.This is the main feature which would also help us scale in future if we want uniformity in our school system.</li>
<li><strong>Auto Registration Of college in case of large database</strong>-AICTE is a government institution with numerous colleges under its control.Thus registering each collge on our website manually will be a hectic task.Thus our backend algorithm comes into play here wherein the entire college data from the database is fetched just by one button click and the colleges are emailed the Login ID and Password.</li>
<li><strong>Statistical Data</strong>-There are numerous colleges in India and the more the people search for a particular college the better will be the rank of the college.Thus so as to predict the admissions,to keep track of userbase and to compete in creating a larger userbase will together be reflected statistically on the college dashboard.</li>
<li><strong>Efficient Algorithms</strong>-The backend algoritms be it search rank,calender planning,bookmarking or many more features the backend algorithm has been written with the utmost efficiency so that there is more of logic and less of code that works at the back, without any compromise on the perfomance.</li>
<li><strong>Data Security</strong>-The entire database is managed in a very effcient manner with our main focus on data hiding and prevention of data leaks.All the passwords on the site have been encrypted and also we have not allowed AICTE admin to directly access the college passwords and auto generated the passwords to add an extra layer of protection.</li>
<li><strong>One Stop platform for the entire university event planning</strong>-The highlighting and the main feature of our project is the calender which will be a centralized and once AICTE mentions the event deadlines the events will be organized into 3 groups-Acadmeic,Events and T&P automatically and thus would help to create a one stop platform for uniforming the university event management.</li>
